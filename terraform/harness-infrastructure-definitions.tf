# Harness Infrastructure Definitions Configuration
#
# MOVED TO GIT-BASED MANAGEMENT
# Infrastructure definitions are now managed in Git (.harness/.../envs/.../infras/)
# and imported manually via Harness UI.
#
# Rationale (from CLAUDE.md "Hybrid Harness Management"):
# - Terraform is EXCELLENT for: Environments (with AWS outputs), Secrets, Connectors, Service
# - Terraform is PROBLEMATIC for: Remote templates/pipelines/infrastructure (timeouts, feature flags)
# - Infrastructure definitions already in Git anyway (true GitOps)
#
# Location: .harness/orgs/default/projects/bagel_store_demo/envs/<env>/<env>/infras/

# COMMENTED OUT - Managed in Git instead

#   for_each = local.harness_environments
#
#   identifier      = "${each.value.identifier}_infra"
#   name            = "${each.value.name} Infrastructure"
#   org_id          = var.harness_org_id

#         # exists to satisfy Harness validation requirements for CustomDeployment type.

# Output infrastructure definition identifiers for reference
# COMMENTED OUT - Infrastructure definitions now managed in Git
# output "harness_infrastructure_identifiers" {
#   description = "Harness infrastructure definition identifiers created"
#   value = {
#     for env in local.environments :
#     env => harness_platform_infrastructure.demo_infrastructures[env].identifier
#   }
# }

# Usage in Harness Pipeline:
# Instead of: (no infrastructure definitions â†’ pipeline fails)
# Use:        deployToAll: true (deploys to the ONE infrastructure definition per environment)
#
# Or explicitly reference:
# environment:
#   environmentRef: psr_dev
#   infrastructureDefinitions:
#     - identifier: psr_dev_infra
#
# Infrastructure definitions reference minimal deployment template (Custom v1.0) for validation.
# Template location: .harness/orgs/default/projects/bagel_store_demo/templates/Custom/v1_0.yaml
# Actual deployment logic: Step Group Template (Coordinated_DB_App_Deployment) handles
# all deployment steps including instance discovery via FetchInstanceScript.
