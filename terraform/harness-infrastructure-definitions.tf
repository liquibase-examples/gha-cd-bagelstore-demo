# Harness Infrastructure Definitions Configuration
#
# Creates infrastructure definitions for CustomDeployment.
# Each environment gets one infrastructure definition that references the Custom deployment template.
#
# Pattern:
# 1. Environment = Container (like a folder)
# 2. Infrastructure Definition = Deployment target (like a file in the folder)
#
# CustomDeployment requires infrastructure definitions to exist, even with deployToAll: true.
# The deployToAll flag means "deploy to ALL infrastructure definitions in this environment",
# not "bypass infrastructure definitions".
#
# Creates 4 infrastructure definitions per demo instance:
# - ${demo_id}_dev_infra
# - ${demo_id}_test_infra
# - ${demo_id}_staging_infra
# - ${demo_id}_prod_infra

# Usage in Harness Pipeline:
# Instead of: (no infrastructure definitions â†’ pipeline fails)
# Use:        deployToAll: true (deploys to the ONE infrastructure definition per environment)
#
# Or explicitly reference:
# environment:
#   environmentRef: psr_dev
#   infrastructureDefinitions:
#     - identifier: psr_dev_infra
#
# Infrastructure definitions reference minimal deployment template (Custom v1.0) for validation.
# Template location: .harness/orgs/default/projects/bagel_store_demo/templates/Custom/v1_0.yaml
# Actual deployment logic: Step Group Template (Coordinated_DB_App_Deployment) handles
# all deployment steps including instance discovery via FetchInstanceScript.
