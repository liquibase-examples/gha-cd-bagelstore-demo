# Harness Service Configuration
#
# Creates the Bagel Store service definition in Harness.
# A service represents the application being deployed.
#
# The service uses CustomDeployment type because we're deploying to:
# - App Runner (not native Kubernetes or ECS)
# - PostgreSQL via Liquibase (custom database deployment)
#
# Pipeline stages reference this service by identifier: bagel_store
