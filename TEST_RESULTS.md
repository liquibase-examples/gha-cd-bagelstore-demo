# Test Results - Steps 1 & 2 Complete

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ PASSED

## Step 1: Verify AWS Resources Exist ✅

### 1a. S3 State Bucket
```
aws s3 ls s3://907240911534-psr-terraform-state/bagel-store/
```
**Result:** ✅ PASS
```
2025-10-19 13:29:51     126291 terraform.tfstate
```
State file exists and is 126KB (matches migrated state).

### 1b. SSM Parameters
```
aws ssm get-parameters --names /psr/image-tags/{dev,test,staging,prod}
```
**Result:** ✅ PASS
```
/psr/image-tags/dev     → latest
/psr/image-tags/prod    → latest
/psr/image-tags/staging → latest
/psr/image-tags/test    → latest
```
All 4 environments initialized.

### 1c. IAM Policy
```
aws iam list-attached-user-policies --user-name harness-bagel-store-deployer
```
**Result:** ✅ PASS
```
HarnessBagelStoreDeploymentPolicy  (existing)
HarnessTerraformSSMAccess         (newly created)
```
New managed policy successfully attached.

## Step 2: Verify Terraform Configuration ✅

### Terraform Plan Execution
```
cd terraform && terraform plan
```

**Result:** ✅ PASS - Plan completed successfully

### Configuration Fixes Applied
1. Fixed variable reference: `var.ecr_public_alias` → `local.ecr_public_alias`
2. Moved `ecr_public_alias` to `main.tf` locals (shared across all modules)
3. Removed duplicate from `harness-environments.tf`

### Plan Summary
```
Plan: 0 to add, 9 to change, 0 to destroy
```

### Changes Detected (As Expected)

#### App Runner Services (4 services - dev, test, staging, prod)
Each service will be updated with:

**Health Check:**
- Path: `/` → `/health` ✅

**Image Configuration:**
- Port: `80` → `5000` ✅ (NGINX → Flask)
- Image: Now reads from SSM parameter ✅

**Environment Variables - Added:**
- `APP_VERSION` (from SSM) ✅
- `DB_HOST` (RDS address) ✅
- `DB_NAME` (environment name) ✅
- `DB_PORT` ("5432") ✅
- `DEMO_ID` ("psr") ✅
- `DEMO_PASSWORD` ("bagels123") ✅
- `DEMO_USERNAME` ("demo") ✅

**Environment Variables - Removed:**
- `DATABASE_URL` (broken format) ✅

**Environment Variables - Changed:**
- `FLASK_ENV`: "dev" → "production" ✅

**Secrets - Fixed Names:**
- Added: `DB_USERNAME`, `DB_PASSWORD` ✅
- Removed: `SECRETS_MANAGER_ARN_USERNAME`, `SECRETS_MANAGER_ARN_PASSWORD` ✅

#### Harness Environments (4 environments)
Minor updates:
- Removed descriptions (cosmetic change only)

## Verification Points

### ✅ SSM Integration Working
- Terraform successfully reads all 4 SSM parameters
- Data sources: `data.aws_ssm_parameter.image_tag["dev/test/staging/prod"]`
- All showing value: "latest"

### ✅ S3 Backend Working
- State loaded from: `s3://907240911534-psr-terraform-state/bagel-store/terraform.tfstate`
- Native locking functional (Terraform 1.10+)
- Lock acquired and released successfully

### ✅ Configuration Correctness
All critical fixes present in plan:
- Port corrected (5000)
- Health check path corrected (/health)
- Secret variable names corrected (DB_*)
- Broken DATABASE_URL removed
- DEMO credentials added
- All required env vars present

## Issues Found & Fixed

### Issue 1: Variable Reference Error
**Error:** `Reference to undeclared input variable "ecr_public_alias"`
**Cause:** Used `var.ecr_public_alias` instead of `local.ecr_public_alias`
**Fix:**
1. Changed reference in `app-runner.tf` to `local.ecr_public_alias`
2. Moved definition to `main.tf` locals block
3. Removed duplicate from `harness-environments.tf`
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

### Issue 2: Stale Terraform Lock
**Error:** `PreconditionFailed: At least one of the pre-conditions you specified did not hold`
**Cause:** Previous `terraform plan` interrupted, lock not released
**Lock ID:** `a87b67af-1981-4362-c0be-def603aaad62`
**Fix:** `terraform force-unlock -force a87b67af-1981-4362-c0be-def603aaad62`
**Status:** ✅ Fixed

- Reviewed with security audit
- No credentials in committed files

### Step 4: Commit & Push (Ready - Awaiting User)
Commit message is prepared in `TESTING_CHECKLIST.md`.

### Step 5: Harness Configuration (Pending)
1. Refresh Harness template in UI
