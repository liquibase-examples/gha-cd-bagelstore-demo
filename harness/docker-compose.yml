# Harness Delegate - Docker Compose Configuration
#
# This delegate runs locally and executes deployment commands for Harness CD.
# The delegate needs access to:
# - Docker socket (to run Liquibase containers)
# - Network access to AWS resources (RDS, App Runner, S3, Secrets Manager)
#
# Setup Instructions:
# 1. Create delegate in Harness UI (Project Settings > Delegates > New Delegate)
# 2. Copy ACCOUNT_ID and DELEGATE_TOKEN from Harness UI
# 3. Update environment variables below
# 4. Run: docker compose up -d
# 5. Verify connection in Harness UI
